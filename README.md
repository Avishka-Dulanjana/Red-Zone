# Project Start 2024.01.23

```agsl
 flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create --path=splash.yaml
```

For the Splash screen size is 460 x Width & Height where as the icon inside is only 250 x width & height. This means, the icon should have a space around it. For the Onboarding you can use any size because we are making sure to assign only 60% width to the total screen.
